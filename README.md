# Odin Recipes

This project is part of The Odin Project (TOP) curriculum and serves as a practice exercise to reinforce my HTML skills.

### Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a simple web page that lists links to recipe pages. These recipe pages, which are also developed using plain HTML, will be designed by me. This project will serve as a foundation for practicing CSS in future stages of development.

### Key Features

* **List of Recipe Links**: A clean and easy-to-navigate page with links to individual recipe pages.
* **Plain HTML**: All pages are built using basic HTML to focus on structure and content.
* **Future CSS Integration**: The project will later be styled with CSS to improve layout and presentation.

### Technologies Used

* **HTML**: To create the structure of the webpage and individual recipe pages.
* **Future CSS**: To style the project (to be added in future iterations).

### How to View the Project

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/odin-recipes.git

2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the list of recipe links.
