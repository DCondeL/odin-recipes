    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      The simple smell of onions and potatoes frying in olive oil has the power
      to bring to mind beautiful weekend mornings spent enjoying tortilla
      Española. In the U.S. we’re used to associating the word tortilla with the
      bread made in many Central and South American countries, but the ‘tortilla
      española’ is the Spanish version of Italian frittata, and a perfect
      flavorful meal to enjoy any time of day. This tortilla Española recipe is
      a classic take, but fee free to add your own ingredients for the full olé
      effect!
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 3/4 cup olive oil, divided</li>
      <li>1 large yellow onion, chopped</li>
      <li>3 large russet potatoes, cut into 1/8-inch thick slices</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>5 to 6 eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat 1 1/2 cups of the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat
        until hot. Add the onions and potatoes. Season with 1 teaspoon of the
        salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        As the potatoes cook, press down on them gently with your spatula. Cook
        potatoes until fork tender. Don’t let the potatoes get mushy. When the
        potatoes and onions are done, transfer to a large bowl and let cool
        slightly.
      </li>
      <li>
        In medium bowl, beat the eggs with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the potatoes and onions to the egg mixture; mix well. All the
        potatoes should be covered, but not swimming in egg. There should be
        some extra egg at the top, so if the 5 eggs are not enough add another.

      </li>
      <li>
        Place a large plate upside down over the top of the skillet. Hold it
        firmly in place. Pick up the pan from the handle with your free hand,
        and flip the half cooked tortilla over onto the plate. This needs to be
        quick. Place the skillet back on the stove and gently slide the
        tortilla, uncooked side down, back into the skillet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook until you can feel the tortilla slide a bit in the frying pan. Turn
        off the flame, serve out of the pan or flip the tortilla onto a plate to
        serve.
      </li>
